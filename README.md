# EarthInvaders
Earth Invaders - a Space Invaders clone for the it-talents challenge.

# General
The game is developed in Java using the open-source LibGDX framework in combination with Android Studio.
The Project can be cloned or downloaded and then opened in Android Studio.

# Running the game
I provided runnables for Windows/Mac and a raw .jar file (jre 1.8 will be needed).
All of the runnables can be found within the <a href="https://github.com/flow96/EarthInvaders/tree/master/Runnables">Runnables</a> folder.
<br /><br />
Start the game by double clicking one of the runnables or open a terminal in the root folder of the project and type `./gradlew desktop:run`
<br /><br />
The <a href="https://github.com/flow96/EarthInvaders/tree/master/Runnables/Jar/">EarthInvaders.jar</a> file can be run with a terminal using: `java -jar EarthInvaders.jar`
<br />
